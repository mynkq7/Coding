# Coding & Learning Logs

This repository is a **structured, long-term learning log** covering programming, databases, and system-level concepts.

Each folder represents **hands-on practice**, notes, and experiments done during daily learning — not polished tutorials, but real progress.

This repository is designed to **scale over time** as new technologies and topics are added.

---

## Purpose

- Track daily learning with code
- Build strong fundamentals before advanced topics
- Maintain a clean and organized knowledge base
- Serve as a long-term reference for myself and others

## How to Navigate

- Use **`index.md`** for a quick overview of all topics
- Each folder contains its own README or notes
- Files are intentionally kept simple and readable

---

## Learning Philosophy

- Fundamentals first
- No shortcuts, no copy-paste learning
- Write code → break it → understand it
- Treat learning like building blocks, not checklists

---

## Disclaimer

This repository reflects **learning and experimentation**.  
Code may be simple, repetitive, or intentionally verbose for clarity.
