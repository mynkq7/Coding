## Summary

Day 04 focuses on mastering **looping techniques**, especially how to iterate through lists and strings and selectively skip elements using conditions.

### ✔ For Loops  
Used to iterate over:
- A list of numbers  
- A list of number words  
- Characters in strings  

### ✔ Skipping Values  
Demonstrated how to skip:
- A single specific letter (`M`)  
- Multiple unwanted letters (`B`, `F`, `J`, `N`, `Q`) using **membership checks**  

### ✔ Filtering Logic  
Used `if` conditions and `continue` to remove unnecessary characters during iteration — a useful technique for:
- Cleaning data  
- Filtering payloads  
- Ignoring unwanted input in automation scripts
