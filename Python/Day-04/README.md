Summary

Day 04 focuses on essential looping techniques for iterating through lists and strings, and selectively skipping values.

✔ For Loops

Used for iterating over sequences such as lists and strings.

✔ Iterating Over Lists

Printed numeric lists and number words using simple loop structures.

✔ Iterating Over Strings

Processed each alphabet letter one by one.

✔ Using continue

Skipped a specific letter (M) and a set of unwanted letters (B, F, J, N, Q).

✔ Filtering Logic

Applied membership checks to remove unwanted characters during iteration.

These concepts are widely applied in cybersecurity scripting — such as automating payload loops, filtering character sets, or iterating through wordlists and encoded strings.
