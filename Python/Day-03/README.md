## Summary

Day 03 introduces the essential building blocks for making decisions and repeating actions in Python:

### ✔ Conditional Statements  
Used to check conditions and execute different blocks of code.

### ✔ Logical Operators  
Used to combine multiple conditions.

### ✔ Membership Operators  
Check whether an element exists inside a list or string.

### ✔ For Loops  
Used for iterating over sequences such as lists, strings, and ranges.

These concepts are used everywhere — from automation scripts to cybersecurity tools and even in pentesting for iterating payloads, brute-force loops, etc.

## Mini Projects

### ✔ Mini Project — Guessing Game
A simple interactive program where the user guesses a number and receives feedback if they are too low, too high, or correct.  
**Reinforces:** if/elif/else logic, comparison operators, handling user input.

**Run:**
```bash
python3 guessing_game.py
