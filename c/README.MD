## Summary
Day 01 introduces the **fundamentals of C programming**, including:
- understanding the structure of a C program  
- using header files for input/output and boolean support  
- writing the `main()` function as the program entry point  
- declaring and using variables of different data types  
- printing output to the console using `printf`  
- working with boolean values  
- defining and returning values from functions  

This forms the foundation for low-level programming, system development, and understanding how programs execute at a core level.
